\section{Introduction}
This year, the team TREMA-UNH from the University of New Hampshire, USA participated in the following TREC tracks

\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex Answer Retrieval: Retrieving and ordering passages for a given topic into an comprehensive article.
    \item \$track\_name:  \$track\_description
\end{itemize}


\section{Complex Answer Retrieval}

\textbf{Task.} In the complex answer retrieval track, participants were given a topic with an outline of headings. The task is to retrieve paragraph-sized passages that are relevant for this topic (and each headings) and order them in a topically coherent way.

We submitted the following ten automatic runs, of which \texttt{UNH-tfidf-ptsim} and \texttt{UNH-bm25-ecmpsg} were manually assessed.
